# Music-Intensity-Visualization
This takes an audio file and plays it while changing the background and some lines to match the intensity and sound level. 
I was supposed to do a school project on simple stuff. Went a bit overboard, so I figured I would post that here. 
I used p5 and javascript to make this, but I'm much more proficient in python so there are probably a few mistakes. 
Oh and it's horribly optimized. Enjoy!!!
