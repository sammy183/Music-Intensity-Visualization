//of course it could be used for anything if you change the file path in the preload function
//Also keep in mind that p5 needs that file path in the index.html file in order to work so be sure to fix that

//This was all stuff that I WAS gonna use to make a legit modern art piece that would be pretty simple
//As you could probably tell I went a little overboard. Just a tad. 
//If you didn't know we were just supposed to make ellipses and stuff. 
//Like the most complex thing was gonna be using MouseX and MouseY
